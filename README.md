# Healthcare Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the Healthcare Data Analysis Project repository! This project focuses on utilizing SQL queries to gain valuable insights from healthcare-related data. By applying SQL querying techniques to a healthcare database, we aim to extract meaningful information that can aid decision-making and provide insights into various aspects of the healthcare industry.

## Project Overview

In this project, we tackle a range of healthcare-related challenges using SQL queries and reporting. Our goal is to harness the power of data analysis to answer critical questions and support informed decision-making within the healthcare and medical domains. By working through the provided problem statements, we delve into areas such as patient demographics, disease analysis, insurance claims, pharmacy inventory, and prescription practices.

## Key Objectives

- **Data Exploration:** We explore a healthcare dataset to understand its structure and content.
- **SQL Queries:** We develop SQL queries to address specific problem statements provided by stakeholders in the healthcare field.
- **Insights Generation:** By executing these queries, we generate valuable insights and reports that can aid various stakeholders in making informed decisions.
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Our project demonstrates the power of data analysis in contributing to effective decision-making within the healthcare sector.
